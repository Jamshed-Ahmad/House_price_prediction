# 🏡 Mumbai House Price Prediction – Machine Learning Project

# 🔍 Project Overview <br>
This project aims to predict house prices in Mumbai using machine learning techniques. We implemented and compared Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models, selecting the best-performing algorithm for accurate predictions. The final model is deployed as an interactive Gradio-based web application for real-time price estimation.

# 📌 Key Features <br>
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understanding trends, patterns, and distributions 📊 <br>
✅ Data Preprocessing – Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical data 🛠 <br>
✅ Feature Selection – Choosing relevant features for optimal model performance 🏗 <br>
✅ Model Comparison – Evaluating Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models 🔄 <br>
✅ Best Model Selection – Random Forest Regressor performed the best with the highest accuracy 🎯 <br>
✅ Dynamic Feature Input – No predefined lists; values are picked directly from the dataset 🏷 <br>
✅ Gradio-Based Web Interface – User-friendly web app for real-time price prediction 💻 <br>
